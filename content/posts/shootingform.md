Are you a really good basketball player, but don't know how to shoot the ball right? Well, today you will learn how to use proper shooting form! Hooray!

Step #1

I'm imagioning that you do already, but if you don't, make sure to get a basketball that fits you. It is very important that you have a basketball that fits you because if it doesn't, your shots might not get as close as with a ball your size.

Step #2

It is very important that you get a good feel for the ball in your hands. I know this step isn't about shooting form, but it is very important to have a feel for the ball in your hands. This excersise is ball slaps, take the ball in your hand, and smack it into the other. After awhile, you will find that the ball is more comfortable in your hands.

Step #3

For step #3 you need to get the ball on target. The way to do this is to align your first finger with the rim that you are shooting at. This will make the ball go on target, thus making it easier to go in.

Step #4

Take the ball at about waist level and bring it up until it is at your eyes. When it is at your eyes, release it calmly and do a flick of the wrist while at the final step. When you have done this, you have done very proper shooting form. Now it will be easier to beat Dad at HORSE and one on one!
