Want to make really cool drawings? Follow these steps to learn how!

For this project, you have two decisions. The first decision will be listed right here, followed by its steps, and then the second will be listed.

Decision #1

First, you need somebody, or something to draw. You can probably find the picture on Google Images, which you will need to then print out.

Step #2

If you don't already, go to the store or shop on an online store for tracing paper. If you're wondering what tracing paper is, it is paper that is almost see-through, but not quite. It can be very useful for drawing!

Step #3

Once you get your tracing paper and get your picture printed, you can start! The first thing you need to do is to put your drawing under one of the sheets of tracing paper. After that, all that you have to do is look at the lines on the picture that you printed out, and you just trace the lines. When you are done drawing, congratulate yourself and show your parents/siblings. Just note that this may sound very easy, yet it is not. Just remember to stay calm.

Decision #2

This will be the decision with more steps and mistakes. Remember, be calm and everything will go fine. Also, it doesn't matter how your art shows up, it is great all the same.

Step #1

Go to Google Images and find the picture that you want. This is optional. You can either keep the picture on the screen, or print it out. I suggest printing it out, but do whatever you want.

Step #2

This is nice because you can use whatever paper that you have. If you have colored paper, great! If you have white blank paper, great!

Step #3

As I said, this one will be a little harder because you won't trace. You will copy. Look at the image, and draw everything that you think is needed, everything simple, and if you want everything including the hard parts. You will need to be very calm for this, as there may be more mistakes. After this is done, give yourself a pat on the back, and show it to your parents/siblings. Good job!
